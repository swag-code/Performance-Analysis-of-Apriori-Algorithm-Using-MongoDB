# Performance-Analysis-of-Apriori-Algorithm-Using-MongoDB
In present days there are lots of problems with Excel files and RDBMS(MySQL)
to handle a large amount of data, problems like importing the data, Data accessing
time etc. are very common now. To minimize this problem NoSQL Database MongoDB has come into play. Also,
MongoDB is very popular nowadays so I choose this in my project. It also helps
new MongoDB learners & it is very easy to operate since it is schemaless, join free,
document-oriented database and can handle a large amount of structured or
unstructured data.
I have also implemented the Apriori algorithm using excel,
RDBMS(MySQL) and found that the execution gets slow. So I used MongoDB as
database. At the end, I compared their execution time and found that MongoDB
is 79% faster than excel files and 73% faster than RDBMS(MySQL).
By this project I can prove that in Bigdata environment, MongoDB will
be a great choice and these days there are a lot of demand on the market for NoSQL
applications. So I think this application will be very helpful for people who are
interested in MongoDB to use structured and unstructured data.
